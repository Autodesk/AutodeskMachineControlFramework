This file has been generated by the Automatic Component Toolkit (ACT) version 1.8.0-develop.

Abstract: This is an autogenerated C++ implementation file in order to allow easy
development of Generic Camera Driver for Windows or Linux devices. It needs to be generated only once.

Interface version: 2.0.0

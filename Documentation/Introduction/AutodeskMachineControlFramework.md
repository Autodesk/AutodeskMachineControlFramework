# Introduction to the Autodesk Machine Control Framework


## 1. Background Information & Justification

The standard control software for contemporary Additive Manufacturing Machines significantly deviates in a few areas from conventional machine tools, like Milling and Turning machines. While in the latter the operating model is centered around the real-time PLC and complex motion control, in the Additive Manufacturing space (at least for Laser Powder Bed Fusion, Stereolithography and Inkjet technologies) the motion aspect is less critical on the one hand, but on the other hand it is essential to integrate optics and other control systems that are structurally equal, while operating at a much higher frequency (MHz clock rate) in comparison of common PLCs (kHz clock rate).

In addition to those requirements, the amount of data that needs to be processed is often several magnitudes above what is usually needed in traditional Manufacturing. Build files for large prints can easily reach up to 10 or 20 Gigabytes, easily exceeding the capacity of contemporary real-time control systems.

As a result, the mostly applied software architecture usually consists of a standard PC running the different hardware components in parallel, trying to feed them with the data needed and orchestrate their behavior. There might be a direct wire link between the subsystems for clock synchronization, but even this is not state of the industry.

![](./images/plcvspccentric.png) 

While the traditional space has seen some developments into more connected workflows (using for example UPCUA) in the recent past, but it is still very clear that the focus and central element of a machining process is still the G-Code-like program running in the PLC directly.


Given this speciality, every AM vendor is usually investing heavily in building its own PC control software stack completely from scratch - for a relatively low unit count. This leads to 
- a very fragmented market of proprietary solutions 
- many resource constraints of the necessarily small development teams, resulting in often low software quality
- many overlapping developments in different companies of the same functionality
- while building out their technological core differentiation only receives a tiny fraction of the overall effort.

As users of Additive Manufacturing Machine Tools in general operate a multitude of different machine formats and vendors, this fragmentation creates huge pains in the upstream and downstream process chain (from data preparation to quality control and postprocessing), being a real blocking issue for many applications to become main-stream.

The Autodesk Machine Control Framework is an open software collection that tries to address all of those issues in a structured manner. Similar how Android (TM) has been a backbone and level-setter for the mobile phone industry, it glues together the Upstream CAD/CAM data preparation pipeline with off the shelf hardware components that are sold in the market, trying to become a state of the art reference implementation of how a modern (additive) machine tool software stack should look like from the software side.

Taking away tedious repetitive reimplementations of non-value adding features, this has turned out to be an incredible productivity gain for software teams. Independent if they are trying to build up test systems, commercial grade machines or even retrofitting older machines with new control systems - the case available studies about the Framework's customizability show that it is easily possible for a small team of individuals to develop a completely novel state of the art machine tool within a few months - in industrial product quality.

While most of the work focuses on Laser-based technologies like Metal Laser Powder Bed Fusion and Stereolithography, the basic addressed challenges apply to a much wider range of technologies (like Injket, DLP or Binder Jetting), and also in a field outside of Additive Manufacturing. We do believe that there is a place for the concepts in traditional Manufacturing adjacent AM processes like DED or even Robotics as well, but to stay focused this is out of scope at the foreseeable future.

## 2. Example use case

The whole project was created around a first model use case, based on a tight integration of a CAD/CAM solution (like Autodesk Fusion) and a Machine Control System with a closed feedback loop. Fusion is Autodesk's main stream solution for Manufacturing, covering a wide range of functionality. From Mechanical Design, Generative and Implicit Design to Finite Element Analysis with a variety of Physics - to Manufacturing. The Manufacture environment in Fusion supports several processes, for example 3, 4 and 5 axis milling, turning, sheet-metal cuttong and also of course Metal Additive Manufacturing, both in DED and Laser Powder Bed Fusion. The idea is to provide a mainstream audience access to the technology, with an accessible ease-of-use as well an unbeatable price tag. Looking at the specifics, we assume a closed loop process like the following.

![](./images/exampleusecase.png) 

The desired model workflow steps are

- Prepare parametric models in CAD for Printing, which means orientation, support generation

- Simulate the process with a predictive FEA simulation

- Create and preview the laser toolpath depending on assigned settings at the CAD geometry.

- Automatically send the toolpath to the Machine Control, which handles data management,  hardware control, subsystem syncronization, error handling, etc..

- The hardware consists of off the shelf components from SCANLAB and B&R Automation, which then are used to melt the part.

- The process is monitored with cameras and off-the-shelf in-situ process monitoring solutions, for example a pyrometer from Sensortherm GmbH.

- The data is captured, fed back into the Machine Control Software, which aggregates several sensors from subsystems, and forwards an aggregate view back into the CAD system, where for example it can be overlayed with the earlier process simulation.

- In case there are deviations, or unwanted side effects, there is the possibility to run an outer process loop, which included adapting the model geometry, orientation, toolpathing or support strategy.

- Another option is to use the Control Framework's openness to directly create an in-process control of laser parameters dependent on a non-realtime measurement.

- The third control possibility is to directly use SCANLAB's off the shelf closed-loop control mechanisms to directly influence the melt-pool temperature to a specific regional target that was given in the CAD system or toolpathing kernel.

This workflow depicts pretty much the standard frontier technology state of Academia and the industry. It is important to highlight that the named software and hardware references are examples only, and the flexibility and openness of the framework shall encourage the mixing and matching of any sort of device in any price range. There is no vendor lock in of any kind. Having said that, the implementer's life will of course be much easier if he or she uses already supported components.

As a first principle, the target of this project is not to proof that it is possible at all to create such an implementation per se. The real goal was much more extensive: Creating a framework that allows a small team of engineers with sufficient knowledge of Mechanical Engineering and the AM Process to create such a system within a few months from scratch - without having to have decades of experience in Software Engineering on the one hand - but nevertheless in industrial grade quality on the other.

We strongly believe that this has the potential to free resources and speed up iterative developments. Maybe enough to really increase the velocity of technology developments. And all of this while creating a direct path to production ready deployment of results, an issue that is very endemic for Academic and Corporate Research organisations alike.

## 3. Acknowledgements

The work on this project was mainly pushed by Autodesk Inc. in its quest to make Additive Manufacturing an often applied mass market main-stream technology. But it would not have been possible without many participants and contributors, which are too numerous to name conclusively. As main industrial collaboration partners, we would like to highlight

![](./images/scanlablogosmall2.png) 

- SCANLAB GmbH, the world's leading manufacturer of Laser Scan Systems and other Hard- and Software Components that move laser spots around.

![](./images/brautomationlogo2.png) 

- B&R Automation (A member of the ABB Group), one of Europe's leading provider of PLC systems in general and for the Additive Manufacturing Market.

![](./images/nikonslmlogo.png) 

- Nokia SLM Solutions GmbH, probably the world's leading provider of large scale multi-laser systems. We are tremendously grateful for the exploratively openness of them to try out the framework for some of their farer out R&D technology projects.

The amount of advice and credibility that this collaboration has received from all of them is invaluable.

On the academic side, we are very grateful to our Institutional partners, which guard decades of application experience and were great first-movers to build out the software stack with real-world

- Technical University of Munich, Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management (iwb)

- Technical University of Munich, Professorship of Laser Based Additive Manufacturing

- Technical University of Denmark

And finally we would like to thank the uncountable amount of high profile industry leaders on all continents who have let us waste their time to listen to our conceptual presentations. And then in return even gave us free of charge consulting with real-life feedback and requirements gathering that in aggregation nobody would have been able to come up with in isolation.

This project has probably been the most extensive and wholistic requirements engineering exercise that has been conducted so far in the Additive Manufacturing Industry.


## 4. Open Source methodology

In a commercial context, the machine control software often is seen a sensitive topic by a Machine Tool Maker. It directly touches the crown jewels of its intellectual property, and any proprietary outside dependencies are regularly subject to strict scrutiny. We strongly believe that any viable business proposal in this area must include a complete code ownership by the OEM.

There might be other commercial models supporting those constraints - like detailed maintenance contracts with source code escrows. However, as real world experience shows, the legal and monetary arrangements in those cases are extraordinary complex. The negotiation and execution of such contracts often proves to be very difficult, especially if they have to be uphold over long time periods.

The associated risks are hard to estimate. Small supplier companies at any time can go bankrupt in an upcoming crisis, larger corporations are prone to regular changes in strategy and even divestments of whole business lines. In the rare best case the extensive paperwork is well-written and does not contain inherent inconsistencies. But even then the Machine Tool Vendor might be legally protected and entitled to a continuous operation in theory - while in practice facing the reality of a sudden loss of technical access to his business critical software stack.

In our opinion, the cleanest, easiest, and most attractive option is to maintain a central Framework code under a permissive open source license. While this does not 100% avoid any maintenance risk, it at least opens a realistic path to independence should the supplier relationship become impacted in any form.

While there are many open source licenses that would fit, the selected one ideally should be as short and clear as possible. Self-perpetuating licenses like GPL or LGPL add complexity and are not in line with creating applications in commercial environment.

# I The AMCF Core System

## 1. Engineering Principles and Design choices

The following chapter shall outline the philosophical principles that were followed during the development, as well as the design choices that follow as consequence.


### 1.1. Separation of Framework and Machine specialization

In our decade-long experience in operating Additive Manufacturing machines, we have seen many different approaches to implement a proper machine control software stack. Most software solutions in the field are custom made for a certain machine series, with a large variation in certain aspects like user experience, but at the same time being very similar on what they do at the core. Depending on the market, history and development resources, a vendor would make or have to make different choices, and subject itself to different constraints. Looking wholistically, the overlap between different software stacks is striking none-the-less, and the question arises, if one could develop a common architecture for a majority subset of available systems.

The key to create such a reusable system is a proper level of abstraction. It is essential to capture most of the possible functionality of an industrial Additive Manufacturing system, and implement it into the core. But to adapt to different printing technologies, one also needs to create an extensive plugin system that allows to specialize the framework to most specific use cases.

We believe the core should at least cover the following areas, which are broadly applicable for most Additive Manufacturing Processes:

- A Deterministic execution logic on the system, containing all state defining variables.

- Proper Version control of all system components

- User management, support for user roles and authentication

- An established logging system, with hierarchical granularity

- A reusable mechanism for quick development of User Interfaces and HMI

- A concept how to include proprietary hardware and SDKs

- A backend relational database for storing meta data

- Data schema versioning and migration schemes for updating

- Proper binary data management (Build files, image data etc..)*

- Build data parsing and extraction

- Multi-threading and subsystem synchronisation


In addition to those specifics, more in general we believe the framework should also provide functionality that is usually shpped via third party libraries that are often painstakenly difficult to include in a large project. This includes

- XML, JSON and ZIP parsers/writers

- Generic TCP/IP Networking code

- Generic OPCUA connection functionality

- Other connectivity support, for example UART and ModbusTCP

- Statistics and Time Series

- Image compression, display and manipulation

- Slicing and rasterization algorithms

- Video capture, display and manipulation

- Date and time functionality, timing measurements

- Hash- and Cryptographic functions

- HTTP Clients and REST Servers

- LDAP and other identity protocols, Corporate single sign on

- OpenGL, 3D Graphics and Shader programming                   

- Cloud connectivity and remote control


None of the two dozen points above have any direct connection to a machine maker's process knowledge, and are usually just experienced as cost factor by the software team in charge. And they not only make up a small fraction of the overall effort - but span the majority of the resource investment. The reusuability of this costly, non-differentiating 

### 1.2. Multi-platform, Multi-user, Multi-language Design

While developing a framework with a platform concept in mind, dealing with as many use cases as possible must be one of the priorities. This means to support the big 3 M's:

**Multi-platform:** The code should compile and run on most hardware, operating systems and processor architectures. In our case we would make sure the codebase can compile on:

1. Windows x86, 32bit ("win32")

2. Windows x64, 64bit ("win64")

3. Linux x86, 32bit ("linux32")

4. Linux x64, 64bit ("linux64")

5. Linux ARM, 32bit ("arm32")

6. Linux ARM, 64bit ("arm64")

7. Mac OS X Intel ("mac64")

8. Mac OS X ARM ("macarm")


As those are many configurations, in order to balance complexity with the need of the majority of applications, we will publish precompiled binary releases for the top three platforms in the field (win64, linux64, arm32).

**Multi-user:** User authentication is a complex topic, which really should not be left to the specialization code. The framework should come with a proper login system and user database, which allows to record who did what and when in the operating and administration modes of the machine. The user experience should be tailored to a certain assigned user role, and there should be a permission mechanism to ensure that nobody can perform actions exceeding one's role priviledges.


**Multi-language**: In order to be a commercially viable software solution, the framework should also come with its internal internationalization scheme that allows it to support multiple client-facing languages in a dynamic way - which means the language setting should be on a per-user basis and be changeable either instantaneously or between logins.

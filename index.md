## Welcome to Autodesk Machine Control Framework

Currently, Autodesk Manufacturing software is not directly controlling the hardware: our customers use various proprietary software from the machine builders to make the part. Autodesk Machine Control is an open source middleware framework to integrate CAD/CAM software with machine hardware systems into a production-ready, complete and cohesive closed loop system, that can produce high quality products out of the box. Autodesk Machine Control is an Android equivalent open source framework for any manufacturing machines/robots and it reduces the costs and time-to-market for any machine builder in a similar way to what Android did for the mobile phone industry during the last decade. Thanks to the collaboration between Autodesk Research, Fusion 360 and any engineering organization can quickly combine the Autodesk CAD/CAM stack together with any manufacturing hardware to create beyond-state-of-the-art industrial manufacturing system with a fraction of the traditional effort.

# Contributor's Guide
The Autodesk Machine Controller Framework is an open source project.

Contributions are welcome and we are looking for people that can improve existing language bindings or create new bindings or implementation stubs.

You can also contribute by reporting bugs in the [Issue tracker](../../issues), helping review pull requests, participate in discussions about issues and more.

## Filing issues
1. When filing an [issue](../../issues) to report errors or problems, make sure to answer these five questions:
	1. Which version of the Autodesk Machine Controller Framework are you using?
	2. Which operating system, programming language(s) and development tools (compiler/interpreter) are you using?
	3. What did you do?
	4. What did you expect to see?
	5. What did you see instead?

2. When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the [maintainers](#maintainers) of this repository. This way, we can ensure that there is no overlap between contributions or internal development work.

3. Adhere to the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

4. Review, sign and send in either the "Autodesk Machine Control Framework Form Corp Contrib Agmt for Open Source.pdf" if you want to contribute as a corporation or the "Autodesk Machine Control Framework Form Ind Contrib Agmt for Open Source.pdf" (both files are in the main folder of this repository) if you want to contribute as an individual.

## Submitting a pull request
When ready to contribute, fork this repository and submit a pull request that references the issue it resolves. Be sure to include a clear and detailed description of the changes you've made so that we can verify them and eventually merge.

The Autodesk Machine Controller Framework follows the [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model. New developments are integrated into the [develop](../../tree/develop)-branch. The maintainers will create releases from the develop-branch when appropriate.

We currently have three maintainers:
- Alexander Oster alexander.oster@autodesk.com
- Martin Wassmann martin.wassmann@autodesk.com

If you've established yourself as an impactful contributor to the project, and are willing take on the extra work, we'd love to have your help maintaining it! Email the current maintainers for details.
